"""SSRF guard for user-supplied URLs fetched server-side.

Endpoints such as ``/api/config/validate-url`` and the vision-capability probe
fetch arbitrary URLs configured by the user. Local/LAN model servers (Ollama,
llama.cpp) are a legitimate target, so loopback and RFC1918 ranges stay
allowed — but cloud metadata (link-local), broadcast, reserved and multicast
targets are blocked. Scheme is restricted to http/https, plus ``wss`` for
Speechmatics Realtime endpoints (opened by the ASR SDK, never by the guarded
HTTP transport below).

Beyond the static ``validate_fetch_url`` check, this module ships a
DNS-rebinding-safe transport: every request is resolved **once**, validated,
and then *connected to the validated IP* (with the original hostname carried
in the Host header and, for TLS, in the SNI extension). A hostname whose DNS
changes between the check and the fetch therefore cannot redirect the request
onto a blocked target (API7:2023 SSRF / A01:2025).

``build_guarded_http_client()`` returns an ``httpx.AsyncClient`` using that
transport, and ``build_guarded_sync_http_client()`` its synchronous twin for
SDK clients that require a sync ``httpx.Client`` (e.g. the sync ``OpenAI``
client used by the embedding provider). Callers only need to swap their
client construction.
